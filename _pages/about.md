I am a Ph.D. candidate in Biophysics and Quantitative Biology at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC), focusing on Whole-Cell Modeling (WCM). My current research involves developing comprehensive computational models of the metabolic networks in baker's yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae), leveraging GPU parallel programming techniques. I am passionate about systems biology, computational modeling, and exploring nonlinear dynamics through interdisciplinary collaborations.
