We present the first 4D simulations of the galactose regulatory network in *Saccharomyces cerevisiae* using a hybrid computational framework that integrates reaction‚Äìdiffusion master equations (RDME) with deterministic ordinary differential equations (ODEs). Leveraging the GPU-accelerated **Lattice Microbes** platform, we simulate stochastic gene regulation and deterministic metabolic reactions within a realistic cellular geometry derived from **cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET)**.

This high-resolution structural data enables spatial partitioning of cytosolic and ER-bound ribosomes, allowing for more accurate modeling of protein translation, including membrane-targeted proteins like the galactose transporter **Gal2**. Simulations show that exposure to **11 mM extracellular galactose** induces rapid expression of **10,000‚Äì15,000 Gal2 transporters** within **60 minutes**. We also benchmark **multi-GPU performance** across spatial decompositions.

Our results highlight the impact of **spatial heterogeneity** on cellular decision-making and demonstrate the feasibility of **whole-cell modeling in eukaryotic systems**.
